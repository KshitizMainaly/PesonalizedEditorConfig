# 🧩 Personal Dev Environment Setup

> A minimal, ergonomic, and cohesive development workflow — fine-tuned for speed, focus, and consistency across tools.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains my personal configuration files designed to create a **unified developer experience** across terminal, editor, and navigation tools.

Every component is chosen and configured to complement the others, forming a **seamless workflow** that prioritizes:

- ⚡ Efficiency  
- 🧠 Muscle memory consistency  
- 🧭 Fast project navigation  
- 🎨 Visual clarity  
- 🧍 Ergonomic control (less hand movement, more flow)

## 🛠️ Core Stack

| Tool | Purpose | Key Notes |
|------|----------|------------|
| **[Helix](https://helix-editor.com/)** | Primary text editor | Modal editing, minimal, fast; inspired by Vim but designed around modern language support |
| **[WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/)** | Terminal emulator | GPU-accelerated, Lua-configurable, consistent cursor and color styling with Helix |
| **[Yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io/)** | File manager | Fast, terminal-based, opens projects or files directly into Helix |
| **[Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)** | Git UI | Seamless Git workflow in terminal — plays nicely inside WezTerm splits |
| **[Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)** | Directory jumper | Smarter `cd`; used to jump instantly between projects or repos |
| **[Nutshell](https://github.com/OSCPU/NutShell)** |Modern shell | nutshell feel like more like programmign languate than shell itself, it feels very modern but less popular than pwsh but has its own cwd inheritance and extremely fast|

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This setup focuses on **ergonomic fluency** — tools that *feel* natural to chain together:
